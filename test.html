      <h2>ABOUT CHIRAG GUPTA</h2>
      <p>
        Every startup has a story. Ours began with a quiet determination and a young man who didn’t wait for the 
        “right time” — he created it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Chirag Gupta, the founder of <strong>Technove Global Software Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, started working when most 
        people were still figuring out what they wanted from life. Driven by circumstances but fuelled by ambition, 
        he stepped into the world of work not by choice, but by necessity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From taking calls in a call center to managing sales, distribution, and eventually launching his first startup 
        at 29, Chirag’s journey has always been grounded in learning by doing — not from textbooks, but from the market, 
        the people, the hustle, and the hard days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, he earned an MBA, but it’s his <strong>18 years of hands-on experience</strong> that has been 
        his greatest teacher. He has sold, negotiated, failed, learned, adapted, and built — again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
        His deep understanding of technology, combined with his commitment to creating sustainable, impactful products, 
        has led to the establishment of Technove Global as a trailblazer in the business industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        A true believer in the power of education and mentoring, our chairman is dedicated to shaping the future by 
        investing in the growth of upcoming generations. His vision for Technove Global extends far beyond business success 
        — he aspires to inspire others to think boldly, innovate tirelessly, and push boundaries to make a positive impact.
